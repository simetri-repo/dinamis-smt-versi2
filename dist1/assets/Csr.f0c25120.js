We try to decrease the CO2 ouput and other gas emission from our factory and offices. We follow the government regulations and try to minimize the waste that our factory produce everyday. Not only do we restrict the waste production to save money but also to protect environment as we know that energy is becoming more scarce in the future. <br><br>At Simetri offices, we also try to save on electricity and running water. We carefully allocate the use of paper for printing and photocopy. As a company that is based in a country where forests are main resources, we recognize the importance of preserving paper. Lots of paper waste will only increase the production of paper by cutting trees. It takes trees 10-20 years for them to grow until they are large enough to be cut. <br><br>To save the earth and our future generations, Simetri teach the employees to apply our saving programs in their household. We teach them that it will save them money, teach their children important lessons, and give their future generations a sustainable environment for them to live peacefully. </p></div><div class="divider divider-center divider-border"><i class="fas fa-hard-hat"></i></div><div class="col-md-6"><h3><strong class="color">Community</strong> Development</h3><p align="justify"> Since 2003, Simetri puts aside a percentage of our profit annually to charity.
