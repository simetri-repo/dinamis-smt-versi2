              As one of the best performing companies in Indonesia, Simetri is
              committed to participate in any activities that enhance people’s
              quality of life and environmental sustainability. We believe our
              responsibility could bring positive effects to the development of
              people as well as environment. Simetri feels it is our duty to
              contribute to the development of both environment and people,
              because their growths are adjacent to the company’s growth.
              <br />
              <br />Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is Simetri’s
              commitment and responsibility for our nation, people, and
              environment. We commit to enhance CSR through inspiring and
              environment-friendly activities. The implementation of Simetri’s
              CSR program is to create a secure, comfortable, and dynamic
              community as well as healthy and sustainable working area.
              <br />
              <br />Simetri expects improvements in people’s lives and
              environment by fully supporting the CSR. With improvements that
              have been made, Simetri will be able to bring good effects for
              people and the environment, and also sustain a good company
              growth. Simetri’s current involvement in CSR is grouped into three
              areas: community, environment, and employee.
              <br />
              <br />Simetri cares for the fellowship and family of every
              employees. The events that we hold annually are Simetri
              realisations for the company’s aim: “Grow with the nation, good
              for the people.”

            <h3><strong class="color">Environment</strong> Development</h3>
            <p align="justify">
              In Cikupa, Tangerang, Simetri analyzes the effect of the
              industrial waste to the surrounding area and work hard to prevent
              the industrial waste damaging the surrounding area. We try to
              decrease the CO2 ouput and other gas emission from our factory and
              offices. We follow the government regulations and try to minimize
              the waste that our factory produce everyday. Not only do we
              restrict the waste production to save money but also to protect
              environment as we know that energy is becoming more scarce in the
              future.
              <br />
              <br />At Simetri offices, we also try to save on electricity and
              running water. We carefully allocate the use of paper for printing
              and photocopy. As a company that is based in a country where
              forests are main resources, we recognize the importance of
              preserving paper. Lots of paper waste will only increase the
              production of paper by cutting trees. It takes trees 10-20 years
              for them to grow until they are large enough to be cut.
              <br />
              <br />To save the earth and our future generations, Simetri teach
              the employees to apply our saving programs in their household. We
              teach them that it will save them money, teach their children
              important lessons, and give their future generations a sustainable
              environment for them to live peacefully.

              Since 2003, Simetri puts aside a percentage of our profit annually
              to charity. We pledge to do this every year to help the
              unfortunate people. Simetri always gives donations to charity and
              social activities as a realisation of company responsibility to
              their surrounding environment. Simetri believes giving to charity
              must be alongside doing business.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              Simetri donates a sizeable proportion of annual profit to the
              local orphanage and those others who are in need of help. We help
              make their lives better by bringing them closer to education.
              Education as we know is essential to the development of a nation
              and its people. We participate in growing the nation by
              establishing a good foundation in education for the people.
            </p>
